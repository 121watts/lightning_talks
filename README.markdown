## Overview

Each six-week class each student will give one five-minute lightning talk.

## Expectations

The week of their lightning talk, a student will:

* attend all prep sessions
* come prepared to those sessions with the needed content
* spend 3-6 hours, in total, preparing their presentation
* deliver the presentation in front of their class and other students
* take care to promote a welcoming environment for all students regardless
of their age, gender, socio-economic background, religious beliefs, or sexual
orientation

## Topics

Students will work with the facilitator to select their topic and prepare the
presentation. Topics should fit into one of the domains below. Each week there
may only be *one* talk per domain, but not all domains will be used.

* Ruby architecture (patterns, approaches, etc)
* JavaScript architecture (patterns, approaches, etc)
* General software methodologies / techniques
* Software testing
* Historical or present-day people in Computer Science
* Design / User Experience
* Computer Hardware
* Software libraries (Ruby, JavaScript, etc)

## Schedule

All prep sessions take place at 4:05PM.

* Monday: Establishing topics
* Tuesday: Outline
* Wednesday: Draft slides & content
* Thursday: Rehearsal

## Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become
expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic
and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec"
is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.
